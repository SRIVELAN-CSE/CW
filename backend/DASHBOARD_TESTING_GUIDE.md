# 🚀 Dashboard Data Verification Guide

This guide shows you exactly how to verify that all dashboard functionalities are working and data is being stored correctly in MongoDB Atlas.

## 📊 Database Status Overview
- **Total Users**: 15 (12 public, 2 officers, 1 admin)
- **Total Reports**: 22 (various categories and priorities)
- **Total Certificates**: 10 (birth and income certificates)
- **Total Registration Requests**: 10 (officer registration requests)

- **Total Notifications**: 6 (report updates and announcements)

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Verification Steps

### 1. Check Database Connection
```bash
cd backend
node inspect-database.js
```
This will show you the complete database state with all collections and data counts.

### 2. Test Backend API Endpoints
```bash
# Start the backend server
node server.js

# Test in another terminal or browser:
# Dashboard Stats: GET http://localhost:5000/api/dashboard/admin/stats
# Reports: GET http://localhost:5000/api/reports
# Users: GET http://localhost:5000/api/auth/users (requires admin token)
```

### 3. Frontend Dashboard Testing

#### 📱 **Public Dashboard** - Test These Features:
- **Report Submission**: Create new reports (should add to reports collection)
- **Certificate Applications**: Submit birth/income certificates
- **Need Requests**: Submit community needs
- **Feedback**: Submit service feedback
- **View Reports**: See all submitted reports
- **Notifications**: Check notification center

#### 👮 **Officer Dashboard** - Test These Features:
- **Assigned Reports**: View reports assigned to you
- **Report Management**: Update report status, add comments
- **Certificate Processing**: Process certificate applications
- **Performance Metrics**: View your performance statistics
- **Notifications**: Receive assignment notifications

#### 🔧 **Admin Dashboard** - Test These Features:
- **User Management**: View all users, approve registrations
- **Report Assignment**: Assign reports to officers
- **System Statistics**: View comprehensive analytics
- **Password Resets**: Manage password reset requests
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass assign reports, bulk updates
- **System Settings**: Manage application configuration

## 🔍 Data Verification Methods

### Method 1: Database Inspection Tools
```bash
# Comprehensive database analysis
node inspect-database.js

# Quick queries for specific data
node quick-query.js
```

### Method 2: API Testing with curl/Postman
```bash
# Get dashboard statistics
curl -X GET "https://civic-welfare-backend.onrender.com/api/dashboard/admin/stats" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Get all reports
curl -X GET "https://civic-welfare-backend.onrender.com/api/reports"

# Search functionality
curl -X GET "https://civic-welfare-backend.onrender.com/api/search/global?query=garbage"
```

### Method 3: Frontend Dashboard Navigation

1. **Login Process**: 
   - Use existing users: `admin@civicwelfare.com` (admin), `testofficer@example.com` (officer)
   - Or register new users through the app

2. **Dashboard Navigation**:
   - Switch between different user roles
   - Access different dashboard sections
   - Submit forms and verify data persistence

3. **Real-time Testing**:
   - Submit data in one dashboard
   - Check if it appears in relevant sections
   - Verify notifications are created

## 📈 Expected Data Flow

### When you submit a report:
1. **Frontend**: Form submission → API call
2. **Backend**: Validation → Database storage → Notification creation
3. **Database**: New record in `reports` collection + `notifications` collection
4. **Dashboard**: Report appears in admin/officer dashboards

### When you register a new officer:
1. **Admin Panel**: Submit registration request
2. **Backend**: Store in `registrationrequests` collection
3. **Admin Dashboard**: Request appears in pending registrations
4. **Approval**: Creates new user in `users` collection

### When you apply for certificate:
1. **Public Dashboard**: Submit application
2. **Backend**: Store in `certificates` collection with unique application number
3. **Officer Dashboard**: Application appears for processing
4. **Status Updates**: Notifications sent to applicant

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If data doesn't appear:
1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Verify API endpoints are responding
3. Run database inspection to confirm data storage
4. Check network connectivity to MongoDB Atlas

### If notifications aren't working:
1. Verify Socket.IO connection
2. Check notification creation in backend logs
3. Ensure frontend is listening for real-time events

### If dashboards seem empty:
1. Run `populate-dashboard-data.js` to add test data
2. Check user authentication and permissions
3. Verify API endpoints are returning data

## 🔧 Maintenance Commands

```bash
# Populate test data
node populate-dashboard-data.js

# Clear all test data (be careful!)
node clear-test-data.js  # (create this if needed)

# Backup database
node backup-database.js  # (create this if needed)

# Check database health
node inspect-database.js
```
